This program takes a number of paths in the command line, and a destination
file name, then saves the list of files within those paths to the destination
file, overwriting whatever was in the file previously.  Each path is only added
once to the destination file list / playlist.

The list of files in the file list / playlist created by `genplaylist` will
always be relative to the directory that contains the file list / playlist,
except for the case when a file has non-printable characters, in which case
a proper URL with the non-printable characters escaped will be saved to the
file list / playlist instead.

Only path entries that test positive for the `os.path.isfile()` test
(that means no special devices, no broken symlinks, no directories) will be
included in the output file list.  Unreadable files will be added, but
unlistable directories will be skipped without displaying any errors.
