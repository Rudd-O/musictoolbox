2022-01-12 make each encoder detect which file formats it is capable of encoding/decoding (based on gst-inspect)
2022-01-12 autodetection of which transcoders have the minimum required to run (don't register a transcoder if it lacks programs it needs to work)
2022-01-26 add --help-codecs feature to dump all registered (and also all non-instantiable) codecs, as well as help for each
2022-01-26 pluggable tag copier / transmogrifier as postprocessor
2022-01-12 "copy tags" from NFO files (from videos) too
2021-01-25 do replaygain for files that don't have replaygain information yet (if python3-rgain3 module is available)

2022-01-12 fix the fixplaylist program (make it better, actually)
2022-01-25 parallelize and make interruptible the execution of the synchronization computation, displaying progress

2022-01-26 go through this to-do list and document every feature properly
x 2022-01-12 profile slowness during plan computation (result: it's mostly the ffprobes)
x 2022-01-12 add config setting for all GST transcoders to disable VAAPI with env var LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=fakedriver
x 2022-01-12 force VFAT handling with a parameter, as otherwise Syncthing-Android won't like it
